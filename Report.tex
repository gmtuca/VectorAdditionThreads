\title{Analysis of Vector Addition with Threads}

  \maketitle

  I have written an implementation of addition of two vectors of random contents using Java.
  In order to assure correctness of the program, I approached development using the Test Driven Agile methodology with JUnit tests (attached on the deliverables).

  Upon completing the application, I continued by evaluating its performance, running it multiple times with different parameters (number of threads and vector size).
  By attempting to soften intermittent performance drops/spikes, the program was run 10 times, allowing the gathering of average values.

  At first I thought the increase of threads, given constant vector size, would result on a linear increase of performance. Because each thread has equal load (with a maximum difference of one), vector addition with 4 threads would ideally run twice faster than that with 2 threads of same size.

  This would certainly not be the case for small vector inputs, given that thread initialisation would be a large overhead.
  Another issue would be executing the program on a single core machine, as threads would never run \textit{truly in parallel} and context switching would be an additinal cost.
  
  The following image describes the performance decrease given increase of number of threads for a small problem size of 10,000 elements on the machine \textit{mcore48.cs.man.ac.uk}*. I evaluate this to occur mostly due to the thread initialisation cost. As we can see, the program performs much better with a single thread for this problem size, which means it is quicker to do the whole vector addition sequentially, rather than spending a long time spawning threads which will die after doing few operations.

  For larger problem sizes (\textgreater1,000,000), thread initialization of a few milliseconds starts becoming insignificant compared to the lifetime of each thread.
  The following plot describes the run of my program for the vector size of 10,000,000 with variable threads, where such performance increase is clearly visible.

  This now shows how advantageous multithreaded programming can be for large input problems when few data dependencies are present.
